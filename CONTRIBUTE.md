To ensure that the code quality and maintainability of the School Management System is high, we have a set of guidelines that contributors must follow:
* Code should be written in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
* Code should be well-documented and easy to understand.
* The console should not contain any messy output or error messages.
* Code should be clean and well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns.
* Tests should be written for all new features and bug fixes.
* Changes should be compatible with the latest version of modern browsers.
* Commit messages should be proper and detailed. They should contain information about the feature being added or the bug being fixed.
* Whenever you're working on a new bug/feature/hotfix, you have to create a new branch, and the branch name should be easy to understand.
